# gulp-trial
Setting up a gulp trial to manage different processes

### Install
```console
cd Frontend
(sudo) npm install
bower install
```

### Run Gulp for production
```console
gulp
```
This will perfom a single run and optimize the output for production

### Run Gulp for development
```console
gulp dev
```
Files are not optimized, uglifyed but will include sourcemaps

### Run Gulp for development with livereload
```console
gulp watch
```
Files are not optimized, uglifyed but will include sourcemaps, this process will keep running monitoring for changes and firing livereload when needed.

### ToDo list
fonticons
sprites
